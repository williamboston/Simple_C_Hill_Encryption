# Simple_C_Hill_Encryption

A novel program to help me learn the Hill Cipher and Pointers/Structs/Lists.

Takes any length string as main args then takes 4 (2x2) key matrix values in the order:

1 2
3 4

Outputs a char *string of the cipher text.

Notes:
- Currently only takes 2x2 matrix
- Assumes a 27 letter alphabet (i.e. will always encrypt spaces)
- Outputs cipher text to terminal

Further improvements would be to fix these up and compartmentalise main.
